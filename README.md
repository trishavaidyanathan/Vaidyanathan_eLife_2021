Scripts are separated for each figure and for each figure panel.
Each figure script begins with a description of the datasets used in that figure (found on Dryad)
Each figure script also contains steps for pre-processing the data found on Dryad.
Each script may call other functions that are described in comments and found in the repository under "sleep scoring" or "dependencies"
Note, the chronux toolbox is also required for these scripts.
